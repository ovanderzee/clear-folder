# Changelog

## [2.0.0] - 2020-06-05

After a year it was time to mature clear-folder a bit.
The main intention is the scripts section of the package.json,
still bare-bones.

### Added
- Brief alias 'cf' for the command name 'clear-folder'
- Errorhandling and error messages
- Tests
- Formatting

### Changed
- Path operators ( '.', '..', '~' ) are rejected now.
